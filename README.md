# Wavelet Analysis of S&P 500 Returns

## Introduction

This project applies wavelet analysis to S&P 500 log returns, providing a multi-scale decomposition of market behavior. By separating market movements into different frequency components, we gain insights into trends, cycles, and volatility patterns across various time scales.

## Project Description

The core of this project is a Python script that:
1. Fetches S&P 500 data from Yahoo Finance
2. Calculates log returns
3. Performs a wavelet decomposition using the Daubechies 8 wavelet
4. Visualizes the results in two separate plots:
   - Original returns and long-term trend (A5)
   - Detail levels (D1-D5) showing different frequency components

This analysis is particularly useful for:
- Identifying long-term market trends
- Analyzing market cycles at different time scales
- Studying volatility patterns
- Developing multi-scale trading strategies

## Analysis Explanation

Wavelet decomposition breaks down the original signal (S&P 500 log returns) into:

1. Approximation (A5): Represents the smoothest, long-term trend
2. Details (D1-D5): Capture fluctuations at different frequencies

- D5: Lowest frequency details (e.g., quarterly patterns)
- D4, D3: Medium-term fluctuations
- D2, D1: Highest frequency details (e.g., daily, weekly patterns)

The Daubechies 8 wavelet is used for its good frequency localization properties.

## Results Interpretation

1. Original Signal vs. A5:
   - The original signal shows daily log returns
   - A5 reveals the underlying long-term trend, smoothing out short-term volatility

2. Detail Levels:
   - D5, D4: May reveal quarterly or monthly patterns
   - D3: Often captures swings relevant for medium-term trading
   - D2, D1: Show short-term fluctuations, crucial for daily trading and volatility analysis

3. Key Observations:
   - Volatility clustering is often visible across multiple scales
   - Major market events (e.g., crashes) typically show up across all scales
   - Different trading strategies can be developed based on different detail levels

## Future Updates


1. Multi-Asset Analysis:
   - Extend the analysis to multiple assets or indices for comparative studies

2. Machine Learning Integration:
   - Use wavelet coefficients as features for predictive models
   - Implement anomaly detection based on unusual wavelet patterns

3. Performance Optimization:
   - Optimize the code for handling larger datasets
   - Implement parallel processing for analyzing multiple assets simultaneously

4. Additional Wavelet Families:
   - Implement options for different wavelet families (e.g., Morlet, Mexican Hat)
   - Provide comparisons of results using different wavelets

5. Trading Strategy Backtesting:
   - Develop and backtest trading strategies based on wavelet analysis insights

6. Economic Indicator Correlation:
   - Analyze correlations between wavelet components and economic indicators
